# SALAMING LIHIM
***The night is restless, and the myths are awake.***

Hidden deep within the mountains, veiled by mist and silence, lies Biringan, a city of gold and shadow, where myth breathes and legend walks.

Kapres smoke beneath ancient balete trees, their fiery embers glowing in the dark. Tikbalangs twist the paths of wandering souls in the forest. And under the pale moon, the cries of Manananggals pierce the night sky, their wings blackening the stars.

For centuries, these creatures lived side by side, bound by fragile peace and laws older than time itself. But peace is *never eternal*.

The Babaylans, once guardians of balance, now hunger for power. With forbidden spells and whispers of dominion, they weave alliances in secret, binding the mythic kin beneath their banner.

The city trembles, caught between order and ruin.

And yet, where shadows rise, a flicker of resistance is born. From the heart of myth, a hero will awaken, one who will shape the destiny of Biringan.

The question remainsâ€¦ ***who will you become?***
